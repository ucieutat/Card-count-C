This code was created for an optional assignement in a beginner C MOOC

It generates a hand of 7 cards (and not 5, but the adjustments are easy to make), sort it by value of card and count if there's a pair, double pairs, three of a kind, full house or four of a kind
I didn't add yet the flush and the other combinations

I think it can be improved, here I generated a million hands and counted the number of times each combination appeared to see if the program was correct,
if you want to do the same here's the table of probabilities for each combination with a hand of 7 cards :

Hand	            Combinations	Probabilities
Royal flush	      4324	        0.00003232
Straight flush	  37260	        0.00027851
Four of a kind	  224848	      0.00168067
Full house	      3473184     	0.02596102
Flush	            4047644	      0.03025494

Three of a kind 	6461620	      0.04829870
Two pair        	31433400	    0.23495536
Pair	            58627800	    0.43822546
Ace high or less	23294460	    0.17411920
Total	            133784560	    1.00000000
